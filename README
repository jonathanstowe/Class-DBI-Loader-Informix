README for Class::DBI::Loader::Informix

Introduction
===========

This package provides a Class::DBI::Loader implementation and a Class::DBI
sub class that will enable these modules to work nicely with the Informix
database management system.

Prerequisites
=============

This module requires Class::DBI, Class::DBI::Loader and DBD::Informix 
(and all of their prerequisites) to operate.  It has been tested with
the versions specified in the Makefile.PL.

Installation
============

Install the module by executing the following in the directory where you have
unpacked the module distribution:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

You may need to use a different program than make on various different OS.

You will need to run the last step as a user with sufficient permissions to
create files in the Perl library directories - if you require the module to
be installed in an alternative location then you should run the first step as:

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/my/library/directory

You will need to then specify the appropriate location with :

   use lib '/my/library/directory';


BUGS
====

This has only tested with IDS 9.40.UC2E1 and could well be using
specific features of that database.  If reporting a bug please
specify the server version that use are using. 


SUPPORT
=======

All bug reports and patches should be made via RT at:

   bug-Class-DBI-Loader-Informix@rt.cpan.org

That way I'm less likely to ignore them.
